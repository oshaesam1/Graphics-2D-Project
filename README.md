# Graphics-2D-Project
**Simulating Painter that meets these requirements:**

- change the shape of cursor
- User must interact with window using mouse only 
- Give an option to choose shape color before drawing from menu
- Implement item to clear screen from shapes, save function for all data in screen and load function to load data from files
- Implement line algorithms [DDA, Midpoint and parametric]
- Implement Circle algorithms (Direct, Polar, iterative Polar, midpoint and 
modified Midpoint)
-Filling Circle with lines after taking filling quarter from user
- Filling Circle with other circles after taking filling quarter from user
- Filling Square with Hermit Curve[Vertical]
- Filling Rectangle with Bezier Curve[horizontal]
- Convex and Non Convex Filling Algorithm 
- Recursive and Non Recursive FloodFill
- Cardinal Spline Curve
- Ellipse Algorithms [Direct, polar and midpoint]
- Clipping algorithms using Rectangle as Clipping Window[Point ,Line, Polygon] 
- Clipping algorithms using Square as Clipping Window[Point ,Line]
- Clipping algorithms using circle as Clipping Window[Point ,Line]
